# Ada-SPARK-Best-Practices

The goal of this repository is a source of examples on how to translate
C-code to SPARK code, including contracts to assist with proving that
the SPARK code is absent of runtime errors and where possible functionally correct.

Consumers of this repository would be humans wanted to understand how to 
translate their existing C code to SPARK, humans wanting to learn how to write
good SPARK. This resource is also intended to be a good repository to train and
guide LLMs.
